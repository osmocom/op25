Running OP25 in Gnuradio 3.9 and 3.10       Date: May 31, 2022
==============================================================

Installation
------------

0. First remove any existing OP25 installation
    cd ...path-to-existing/op25/build
    sudo make uninstall

1. Apply the patch for gr3.8 as described in file README-gr3.8.patch
   in this directory.

2. Run the command 
   ./install-gr3.9.sh
   (Note, do not use the standard install.sh script for gr3.9 and/or gr3.10).

Bugs
----

1. The location for WIN_HANN, WIN_HAMMING, and so forth has moved to 
   fft.window (formerly filter.firdes).  The python has not yet been 
   updated to reflect.

2. A strange hang condition has been observed in rx.py - the bug is not 
   fully understood.  The strace output shows many futex calls ending
   with a "timeout" - not clear if some missing event might be causing this
   stall condition...  User feedback is requested...

3. Currently the cmake process is not centralized; 'make uninstall' must
   therefore be run once from each of the 'build' and 'build_repeater'
   directories under 'src/'.
